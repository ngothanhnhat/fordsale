### Query Builders

Query builders in PyroCMS work just the same as [query builders in Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/queries) with the addition of a few cool features.

#### Caching Queries

The query builder in PyroCMS provides a direct API for storing query results in the model's `cache collection`. The `cache collection` is automatically cleared when the model's table is altered in any way (such as saving, deleting, etc).

You can set the cache lifetime in `seconds` by using the `ttl` method:

    $results = $model->where('status', true)->ttl(300)->get();

> Caching queries uses the resulting query string including bindings to determine uniqueness.{.note}

#### Enabling Database Cache

You can enable the database cache via the control panel in `Settings > System > Database`. You can also publish the streams configuration and modify the `database.php` file or lastly define `DB_CACHE=true` in your `.env` file.

#### Fetching Fresh Results

If you are leveraging query caching you may want to temporarily omit cache. You can do this by using the `fresh` method.

    $results = $model->where('status', true)->fresh()->get();

#### Manually Flushing Cache

Model related cache is flushed automatically when entries are updated, created, or deleted.
 
You can manually flush the cache by using the model's `flushCache` method:
 
    $model->flushCache();

You can also clear all Laravel cache including database cache using `php artisan cache:clear`.
