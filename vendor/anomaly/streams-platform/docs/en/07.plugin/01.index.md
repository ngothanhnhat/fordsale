## Plugin

This section will go over how to use the built-in plugin that comes with the Streams Platform.

##### Mapping functions to services

The streams plugin leverages function mapping to handle defining multiple functions within the same object.

For example all functions called that start with `agent_` will be mapped to the `\Jenssegers\Agent\Agent` class. When function mapping is being used the suffix will be camel cased into a method name.

For example `agent_is_mobile()` becomes `$agent->isMobile()` and any parameters are passed along accordingly.
