### Relationships

Relationships in Pyro work just like [relationships in Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/eloquent-relationships).

<div class="alert alert-info">**Note:** Relation type field types will generate the relation model method for you! Naming is camel case of the field slug.</div>

### Delete cascade and restrict

You can easily cascade the relation linked to an entity using `$cascades` in the `EntityModel`.

**Example**

    $cascades = [
        'relation'
    ]

You can also restrict the deletion of an entity using `$restricts`.

**Example**

    $restricts = [
        'relation'
    ]
