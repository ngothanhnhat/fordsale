### Versioning

Versioning entry models is as easy as enabling it on your model using the `$versionable` property:

```php
protected $versionable = true;
```

Saving revisions and what was changed will occur automatically now!

#### Temporarily Disabling Versioning

Should you need to temporarily disable versioning you can use the helper methods:

```php
$entry->enableVersioning();
$entry->disableVersioning();

if ($entry->versioningDisabled()) {
    // Versioning is disabled.
}
```

#### Omitting Attributes From Versioning

To disable tracking of attributes from versioning you can use the `nonVersionedAttributes` property:

```php
protected $nonVersionedAttributes = [
    'remember_token',
    'reset_token',
    'password',
];
```

### Accessing Versions

Versions can be fetched off the model instance you want to get versions for:

```php

$current = $entry->getCurrentVersion();
$previous = $entry->getPreviousVersion();

foreach ($entry->getVersions() as $version) {
    $version->getVersion(); // The version ID
}
```

#### Accessing Model Data/Snapshots

You can grab the snapshot instance of the old model off the version instance using the `model` property:

```php
$model = $version->getModel(); // Model Instance
```

You can grab only the data that was changed at that point with `getData`:

```php
$changes = $version->getData(); // array
```
