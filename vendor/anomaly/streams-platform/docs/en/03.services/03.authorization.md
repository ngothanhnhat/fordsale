### Authorization

Authorization in PyroCMS work exactly the same as [authorization in Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/authorization).

<div class="alert alert-danger">**Important:** All authorization services and permissions are bound to the [Users Module](/documentation/users-module) by default.</div>
