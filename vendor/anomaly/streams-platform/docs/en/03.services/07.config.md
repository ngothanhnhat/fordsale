### Config

Configuration in PyroCMS work exactly the same as [configuration in Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/configuration).

#### Overriding Configuration Files

The Streams Platform and usually addons contain their own configuration. So you might ask; How can I edit those configuration files without modifying the addon or package? The answer is that you publish them first.

##### Publishing streams configuration

In order to configure the Streams Platform without modifying core files you will need to publish the Streams Platform with the following command:

     php artisan streams:publish

You can then find the Streams Platform configuration files in `resources/{application}/streams/config`.

##### Publishing addon configuration

In order to configure addons without modifying core files you will need to publish the addon with the following command:

     php artisan addon:publish vendor.type.slug

You can then find the addon configuration files in `resources/{application}/{vendor}/{slug}-{type}/config`.
