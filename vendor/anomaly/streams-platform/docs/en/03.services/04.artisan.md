### Artisan

The Artisan Console in PyroCMS work exactly the same as the [Artisan Console in Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/artisan).

We have however, added a few cool things to it!

#### Specifying an Application

PyroCMS supports multiples applications running from a single PyroCMS installation. Use the `--app={reference}` flag for specifying the application when running artisan commands.

    php artisan asset:clear --app=test_app
