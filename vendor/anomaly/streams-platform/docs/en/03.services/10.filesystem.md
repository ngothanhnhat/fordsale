### Filesystem

Filesystem services in PyroCMS work exactly the same as the [filesystem in Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/filesystem).

The Files module integrates seamlessly into both Laravel's Filesystem and the included Flysystem package from [](https://thephpleague.com/)[https://thephpleague.com/](https://thephpleague.com/).
