### Fields

Fields represent `attributes` for a stream. You can create fields within a namespace and `assign` them to any stream in that namespace.

Once fields are assigned they will appear as `inputs` when creating or editing entries in that stream.

#### Virtualization

Field management is restricted to the Streams module only by default. This makes it easy to separate concerns between developers customizing virtual modules and end users using them.
