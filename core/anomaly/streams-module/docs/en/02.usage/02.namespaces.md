### Namespaces

Namespaces allow you to group related `streams` into meaningful groups. For example you might have `Members` and `Departments` streams in a `Staff` namespace. Streams must only be unique to their namespace. 

#### Virtualization

When enabled namespaces will be behave like "virtual" modules:

- The namespace icon and name will appear in navigation.
- The namespace slug will be used as the virtual module URI.
- Streams within the namespace will become module sections.
- Streams within the namespace will generate separate CRUD permissions.
