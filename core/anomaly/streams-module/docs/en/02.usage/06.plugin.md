### Plugin

This section will go over how to interact with streams to list, view, and update entries.

A fundamental idea to keep in mind is that streams generated within the Streams module are exactly the same as any other stream in the system. They generated a model, have a namespace, stream slug, fields, assignments, etc. 


#### Entries

You can use the `entries` plugin in core to retrieve entries from streams: [/documentation/streams-platform/latest/plugin/entries](/documentation/streams-platform/latest/plugin/entries)


#### Forms

Similarly you can use the stream model in forms via builders or by using the namespace and slug with the `form` function:

    {{ form('staff', 'members')|raw }} // Create a new record
    {{ form('staff', 'members', 1)|raw }} // Edit the first record
