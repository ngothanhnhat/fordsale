### Streams

Streams represent structured data. For example a `People` stream might hold information on people you know. The records within streams are called `entries`.   

#### Virtualization

Virtualized namespaces will use related streams for the virtual sections within the virtual module.

- The stream name and description will display on relevant tables and forms.
- Users will need adequate permissions to read, write, and delete stream entries within the virtual module.
