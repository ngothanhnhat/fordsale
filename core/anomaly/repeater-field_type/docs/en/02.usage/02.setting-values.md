### Setting Values

You can set the repeater field type value with a model instance:

    $entry->example = $entry;

You can set the value with a collection of instances too:

    $entry->example = $collection;

Lastly you can set the repeater field type value with an array of entry IDs:

    $entry->example = [7, 8];
