## Configuration

You can override Files module configuration by publishing the addon and modifying the resulting configuration file:

    php artisan addon:publish anomaly.module.files

The addon will be published to `/resources/{application}/addons/anomaly/files-module`.

#### MIME Types

The `anomaly.module.files::mimes.types` value tells the files module what `type` of file is associated with a given file extension.

If your project deals with strange file types feel free to add them here under the appropriate type.
