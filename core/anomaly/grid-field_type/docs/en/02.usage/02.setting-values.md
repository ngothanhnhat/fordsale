### Setting Values

Setting Grid values is best left to the control panel.

However, you can set the repeater field type value programmatically with a grid model instance:

    $entry->example = $grid;

You can set the value with a collection of grid instances too:

    $entry->example = $collection;

Lastly you can set the repeater field type value with an array of grid IDs:

    $entry->example = [7, 8];
