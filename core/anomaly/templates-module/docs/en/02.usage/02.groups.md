### Groups

Groups represent file folders that help you organize your templates.

When creating and naming template groups keep in mind that the `slug` will be used as the directory name. The `slug` is also used when referring to the template:

    view("templates::group_slug/template_name");

    {{ asset_add("styles.css", "templates::group_slug/template_name.scss");
