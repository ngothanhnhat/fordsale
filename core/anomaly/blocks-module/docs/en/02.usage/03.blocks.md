## Blocks

Blocks are pre-built components of content that can be dropped into an area. Blocks can also be attached to any stream object via the `Blocks Field Type`.

To find a list of available blocks search for `_block-extension` the in our [featured](https://packages.pyrocms.com/) and [community](https://community.pyrocms.com/) repositories. These repositories can also be found in the latest version of the addons module in your control panel.

### Displaying Blocks

Blocks can be attached to any object including areas but the display of them is generally the same.

#### Displaying Area Blocks

To display all the blocks within an area instance you can use the `blocks` plugin function and pass the `id` or `slug` of the area.

```twig
{{ blocks('footer') }}
```

You can also render blocks directly off of an area instance:

```twig
{{ area.blocks.render()|raw }}
```

#### Displaying Field Type Blocks

To display blocks added to a stream via the blocks field type simply use the field slug like you would with any other stream field:

```twig
{{ page.content_blocks.render()|raw }}
```

You can also loop through the blocks individually:

```twig
{% for block in page.content_blocks %}
    {% if block.extension.value.slug == 'example_block' %}
        //
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
```

### Styling Blocks

Blocks come out of the box using a BEM naming standard to make it easier for you to style them consistently:

```twig
<div
        id="block--{{ block.id }}"
        class="block block--{{ block.extension.value.slug }}">

    {% if block.title.value %}
        <h3 class="block__title block__title--{{ block.extension.value.slug }}">
            {{ block.title }}
        </h3>
    {% endif %}

    <div class="block__content block__content--{{ block.extension.value.slug }}">
        {{ content|raw }}
    </div>

</div>
```

> The `content` portion is defined by the block extension. {.note}

### Overriding Blocks

Overriding blocks and the blocks module is the same process as other addons. For more information see the guides on [Extending PyroCMS](https://pyrocms.com/help/developer-tools/extending-pyrocms).
