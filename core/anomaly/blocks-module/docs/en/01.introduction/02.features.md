### Features

The Blocks module is a powerful content management utility that uses drop-in "blocks" of content.

*   Define static areas of editable blocks; i.e. your footer or sidebar. 
*   Use the included blocks field type to add blocks to any streams object like pages or blog posts.  
*   Extension based blocks are installable from Control Panel, powered by addons, and 100% override-able/customizable.
